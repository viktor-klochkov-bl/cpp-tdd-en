// ### Introduction
//
// - The goal of this project is not just to build a simple game, but to
//   experience how good architecture can emerge from a strict TDD process.
// - Write the *simplest possible code* to make each test pass, even if it feels
//   wrong or hardcoded.
// - The magic happens in the **refactoring** step.
// - The stories are carefully ordered to lead towards a clean, decoupled
//   design.
// - Make sure to follow the TDD cycle. Make sure you refactor during each
//   cycle, using the principles discussed in previous lectures.
// - You are not expected to finish the entire project in a single week. Only
//   tackle as much as you can in the time available.

// ### Part 1: Establishing the Core Loop and World Structure
//
// This part focuses on movement and the representation of the world. The
// initial implementation will likely involve hardcoded strings and if
// statements.
//
// A starter kit is available in the repository under
// `code/starter_kits/project_adventure_sk`.

// %% [markdown]
//
// #### **Story 1: Starting the Game**
//
// * **As a player, I want to start the game, so that I can see the description
//   of the starting room.**
// * **Acceptance Criteria:**
//   * When the game starts, the text "You are in the Grand Hall. It is a vast,
//     echoing chamber." is displayed.
// * **Notes:**
//   * This initial story will probably lead you to the creation of a `Game`
//     class.
//   * Don't be afraid to hardcode data for now.
//   * Pay attention to the testability of your code. E.g., prefer to have a
//     method that returns the current output instead of printing directly to
//     the console.

// %% [markdown]
//
// #### **Story 2: Moving to a Connected Room**
//
// * **As a player, I want to move North from the starting room, so that I can
//   explore the world.**
// * **Acceptance Criteria:**
//   * Given I am in the "Grand Hall".
//   * When I enter the command to move north,
//   * I see the text "You are in the Armoury. Racks of dusty weapons line the
//     walls."
// * **Notes:**
//   * This may require you to introduce new concepts in the refactoring step.
//   * Once again, pay attention that you keep the code well-structured and
//     testable. In particular, separate the logic of moving from any user
//     interface code you write.

// %% [markdown]
//
// #### **Story 3: Moving Back and Forth (The "Triangulation" Story)**
//
// * **As a player, I want to be able to move from the Armoury back to the Grand
//   Hall, so that I can navigate between rooms.**
// * **Acceptance Criteria:**
//   * Given I have moved north into the "Armoury".
//   * When I enter the command to move south,
//   * I see the text "You are in the Grand Hall. It is a vast, echoing
//     chamber."

// %% [markdown]
//
// #### **Story 4: Handling Invalid Moves**
//
// * **As a player, I want to be told in which directions I can move.**
// * **Acceptance Criteria:**
//   * Given I am in the "Grand Hall" and there are exits to the North and
//     South, but not to the East and West.
//   * I see an indication that I can only move North or South.

// %% [markdown]
//
// ### **Part 2: Interacting with the World and the Player**
//
// This part introduces new verbs and the concept of a player with their own
// state (inventory).

// %% [markdown]
//
// #### **Story 5: Investigating a Room**
//
// * **As a player, I want to investigate the current room, so that I can find
//   hidden items.**
// * **Acceptance Criteria:**
//   * Given the "Armoury" contains a hidden "rusty sword".
//   * When I am in the Armoury and enter the command to investigate.
//   * I see the text "You search the room. You found a rusty sword!".

// %% [markdown]
//
// #### **Story 6: Taking a Visible Item**
//
// * **As a player, I want to take an item that I have found, so that I can add
//   it to my inventory.**
// * **Acceptance Criteria:**
//   * Given I have investigated the Armoury and found the "rusty sword".
//   * When I enter the command to take the rusty sword.
//   * The "rusty sword" is no longer in the room, and it is now in my
//     inventory.

// %% [markdown]
//
// #### **Story 7: Remembering Room State**
//
// * **As a player, I want rooms to remember their state, so that the world
//   feels persistent.**
// * **Acceptance Criteria:**
//   * Given I have investigated the Armoury, seen a "rusty sword" and a "golden
//     chalice", and taken the "rusty sword".
//   * When I move South to the Grand Hall and then move North back to the
//     Armoury.
//   * The "golden chalice" is still visible, but the "rusty sword" is no longer
//     there.
//   * If I investigate again, the "rusty sword" is not re-discovered.

//
// ### **Part 3: The Architectural Leap (towards Hexagonal Architecture)**
//
// This part focuses on decoupling the core game logic from the user interface.
// These kinds of developer stories should only be used rarely in real projects,
// but we use them here to push towards a clean/hexagonal architecture.


// %% [markdown]
//
// #### **Story 8: The Purity Refactor (A Developer Story)**
//
// * **As a developer, I want to test the game's logic without caring about the
//   console text, so that I can create an AI "bot" that can play the game by
//   reading its state.**
// * **Acceptance Criteria:**
//   * The core Game engine should provide a raw data representation of the
//     current game state (e.g., a dictionary or a Data Transfer Object).
//   * This data object should contain the room description, the path to the
//     room's image, the available choices, and the player's inventory.
//   * A separate component (an **Adapter**) should be responsible for taking
//     this data object and formatting it into the user-facing string for the
//     console.

// %% [markdown]
//
// #### **Story 9: Adding Visuals Easily**
//
// * **As a player, I want to see an image for each room, so that the game is
//   more immersive.**
// * **Acceptance Criteria:**
//   * Given each room has an associated mage.
//   * When I enter a room, the image for that room is displayed above its
//     description.
