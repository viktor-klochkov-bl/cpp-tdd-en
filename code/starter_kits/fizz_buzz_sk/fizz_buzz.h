 * Generates a string corresponding to the "FizzBuzz" logic based on the input number.
 * If the number is divisible by 15, returns "FizzBuzz".

 * If the number is divisible by 3 but not 15, returns "Fizz".
 * If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, returns the number itself as a string.

 * @return A string representing "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or the number itself.
